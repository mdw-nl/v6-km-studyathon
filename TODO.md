* Allow for restricting which (algorihm) functions are allowed on a node
* How do we deal with filtering by a column (COHORT_ID)
* :small_red_triangle_down: Log in nodes printing too much (disclosing parameters/data sent by researcher)

* ~~vantage6: wrong error message~~
  * ~~Created issue: https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/1105~~
* Multi party computation + homomorphic encryption
* Noise:
  * What's a good statistical test to feel comfortable noise is not compromising results?
  * To consider: noise based on variance?
